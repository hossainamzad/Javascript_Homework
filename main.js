Array: ["Sam","Kim","Ron"];
// index always starts at 0. For instance, the index for kim is 1.
// to declare an Array, we need something which is called variable.
var names["Sam","Kim","Ron"];
to access an item in the array:
//we do :
console.log [1];
 
 // i am creating global and local variables and the scopes where they live:
 var myFavorite = {name: "Rick", background: "Police Officer"};
 function favoriteCharacter (){
 	var myFavorite = {name: "John Snow", background:"soldier"}
 }
 // here i declared two variables: one inside the function is local variable, and the one outside the function is global variabe.
 //once call upom the function, it should console log the John Snow and soldier in the screen.
 //once i call upon the console.log (myFavorite); it shoud print out Rick and Police officer.
 

 //pseudo-code algorithm to check a form's validity:
  // check if the email box isnt filled with a blank string.
     // if the email is blank, return the user a value "Invalid" an dthen ask them again to put in a valid inut and keep doing it until a valid enail is provided.
     //the form shoud have two buttons in it: one for Email and the other one is for password.
       //allow the users to enter any combination of nubers and letters they want to type in for password. And, the valid email shoud have a @ sign at the end of the email.
